WPFACT = 1.5
    and how to deal with unequal rise / fall times
    Using 1.5 for now
    read Chapter 9 of logical effort to see if this is valid
Do I want to do W * 2 for the nMOS in the NAND gate?
    I think this is OK
    depends on logical effort calculations.
    How do you go from gate width to the parameters g / p / ...??
Code tidyup
    Add abstract methods so that paths / gates have to have all the relevant functions?
    auto add gates and paths to tsmc180_main.py?
    Coding standards
        vars_like_this? OrLikeThis?
        english / spanish:
            var names

Design some paths
    which paths?
        Single component paths
            can only compare simulated delay with calculated delay
            Cout = 0 -> h = 0 -> d = p
        One gate driving the same sized gate
            can only compare simulated delay with calculated delay
            This and the previous help check our p and g values for each gate, and our tau
        inversor chains of various lengths and various loads?
        Fan out of 4 FO4 - see example 1.2
            is FO4 delay known for our process?
        clock tree?
        ripple carry adder?
        ...?
    Calculate logical effort for paths
    Run monte carlo simulation for paths

Questions
    methodology?
        change all widths randomly?
        change just one width and revert to best?
            what happens if changing any one makes the path worse,
            but changing two at once makes the path better.
            Is that possible?
    Lots of tests give same result, see cadena_inversores_5_resultados.txt
        which is best?
            maybe change if Tp is the same but total width is less?
        How to compare to theoretical result?
            width B - width A?
            width B / width A?
            compare f = gh per stage to f_opt?
            Look at calculated Tp vs simulated?
    Do we just support fixed logic paths, or do we want to try and test other stuff
        buffer insertion?
        Estimated delays vs actual?
    What is the range of widths we need to look at?
        IIRC Capacitance and resistance are not entirely linear based on width
        so we have to pick a range to work in that is roughly linear
    Anything else to do?
        Compare to other methodologies? (see chapter 12.4)
