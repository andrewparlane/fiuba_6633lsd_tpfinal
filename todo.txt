Do I want to do W * 2 for the nMOS in the NAND gate?
    depends on logical effort calculations.
    How do you go from gate width to the parameters g / p / ...??
How to do paths
    Path class
        contains list of gates
        generates netlist of path
        allows setting each dangling input
        restrict first gate to min width?
        Add load to output
    Top level code
        either path test (checks logic of given path)
        or monte carlo sim
            instantiates the path and then runs the simulation lots

Design some paths
    Calculate logical effort for paths
    Run monte carlo simulation for paths

Questions
    methodology?
        change all widths randomly?
        change just one width and revert to best?
            what happens if changing any one makes the path worse,
            but changing two at once makes the path better.
            Is that possible?
    Lots of tests give same result, see cadena_inversores_5_resultados.txt
        which is best?
            maybe change if Tp is the same but total width is less?
        How to compare to theoretical result?
            width B - width A?
            width B / width A?
    Do we just support fixed logic paths, or do we want to try and test other stuff
        buffer insertion?
